## It took me a good 20 min to get this to print, what is this demonic language

defmodule BasicIO do
  IO.puts("===================ELIXIR IO===================")
  # get the input from the user and store in a variable
  num = IO.gets("Enter a number: ")
  # print the number to the screen
  IO.puts("You entered: ")
  IO.puts(num)
  IO |> "ehyyy"
end

defmodule FileIO do
  # TODO: write to file and then read again
end
